# Surgery Infection Data in California

I would like to investigate surgery infection data in California’s hospitals. 
Plots created are:
1)	Bar chart to show the infection rate for each county in California
2)	Box plot for infections reported for each category of surgery operations. 
Data still needs cleaning. I need to focus on most contributing factors and for that I wanted to create a Praeto chart to understand which data points I need to choose. From initial stats of the dataframe, Los Angeles country has the most infections reported but that’s based on raw data. I want to get the population of each county from another resource to calculate the normalized data which will give me a more meaningful information about infection rates in surgeries.
